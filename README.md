# Digit classifier

Simple digit classifier working with webacam images originally presented at [AI Bridge](https://katedry.czu.cz/kii/aibridge) workshop at 28th February 2024.

This webapp is a simple practical example of using an exported trained prediction model in another application. The documented and commented code used to create the model is available [in this notebook](digit_classifier.ipynb).
